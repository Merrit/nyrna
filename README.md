# Nyrna


**Nyrna allows the user to pause any game or application on their PC.**

The reason for this project is to have a function on PC similar to the incredibly useful sleep/suspend function found in consoles like the Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation; suspend your game (and its resource usage) at any time, and resume whenever you wish - at the push of a button.

That said this can be used to pause normal, non-game applications as well. For example: while doing a long 3D render, or maybe a video encoding job, the CPU and GPU resources are being hogged by said task - maybe for hours - when you would like to use the system for something else. With Nyrna you can pause that program, freeing up the CPU and GPU resources (not RAM) until the process is resumed, without losing where you were.

Nyrna works on Linux with X11 and Microsoft Windows (tested on Windows 10).

- To change the hotkey: Right click tray icon -> `Change Hotkey`

# Disclaimer

I have not had any issues using Nyrna, however keep in mind it is possible something could go wrong with a suspend. So please remember to always save your work and games.

# In case of issue

I haven't seen an issue like this, however if at any time the hotkey isn't working to resume, you can always manually find your process in task manager and resume or send signal SIGCONT / CONT:

# Development Plans

- Suspend multiple applications at once
- Informative error dialog with issue reporting
- Settings screen
- Option to minimize before suspend
- Automatic check for updates
- AppImage for Linux
- ~~Chocolatey distribution for Windows~~ ✅

# FAQ

**Can I suspend to disk so that I can restore after reboot / free up RAM usage / etc?**

Unfortunately no. [CRIU](https://criu.org/) looks very promising to allow us to do this (on Linux), however it [does not currently support suspending GUI applications](https://criu.org/X_applications).
