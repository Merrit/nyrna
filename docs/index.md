Similar to the incredibly useful sleep/suspend function found in consoles like the Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation; suspend your game (and its resource usage) at any time, and resume whenever you wish - at the push of a button.


## Suspend Games

- Pause cutscenes to read the subtitles, examine the scene, answer the door, etc.
- Pause games that can't normally be paused (single-player games like Dark Souls, Elden
  Ring, etc)
- Suspend games whose pause screens keep the system running hot or playing
  unwanted music
- Suspend inbetween checkpoints (example: Hollow Knight)


## Suspend Applications

Nyrna can be used to suspend normal, non-game applications as well. For example:

- 3D renders
- video encoding
- software compilation

The CPU and GPU resources are being used by said task - maybe for hours - when
you would like to use the system for something else. With Nyrna you can suspend
that program,
freeing up the resources (excluding RAM) until the process is resumed,
without losing where you were - like the middle of a long job, or a gaming session
between save points.

# Disclaimer

I have not had any issues using Nyrna, however keep in mind it is possible
something could go wrong with an application while suspended. So please remember to always save
your work and games.
